  - What data we collect (profiles, stats)
  - How we use it (local substitution only)
  - Where it's stored (chrome.storage.local, encrypted)
  - User rights (access, export, delete)
  - Contact: GitHub Issues
  - Created: `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` and `privacy-policy.html`
  - **TODO:** Host on GitHub Pages and update manifest.json

- [ ] **Terms of Service** (recommended)
  - Acceptance of terms
  - User responsibilities
  - Limitation of liability
  - Governing law

### 2C. Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove debug console.logs (or make conditional on debugMode)
- [ ] Add production error handling (graceful failures)
- [ ] Add user-facing error messages (not just console errors)
- [ ] Test error states (network failure, storage full, etc.)

**Time: 5-7 days**

---

## Phase 3: API Key Vault (Week 3-4) üöß IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Build FREE + PRO tier feature (10 keys FREE, unlimited PRO)

### Tiers
- **FREE:** 10 stored keys max, OpenAI detection only
- **PRO:** Unlimited keys, all detection patterns (GitHub, AWS, Stripe, etc.)

### Tasks (from feature_api_key_vault.md)
- [x] Build APIKeyDetector class ‚úÖ Created
- [x] Add types to types.ts ‚úÖ Completed
- [ ] Integrate with serviceWorker (auto-redact mode)
- [ ] Auto-detect common key formats (OpenAI, GitHub, AWS, Stripe)
- [ ] Vault UI in Settings tab with FREE tier counter (e.g., "3/10 FREE")
- [ ] Add/delete keys
- [ ] Stats tracking ("47 keys protected this month")
- [ ] Warn-first mode (dialog before sending)
- [ ] Upgrade prompt when FREE limit reached

### Completed
- Created `src/lib/apiKeyDetector.ts` with:
  - Pattern matching for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS, GitHub, Stripe
  - Generic hex/base64 detection (opt-in)
  - Custom pattern support
  - Redaction modes: full, partial, placeholder
- Added types: `APIKey`, `APIKeyFormat`, `APIKeyVaultConfig`
- Updated `UserConfig` to include optional `apiKeyVault` field

### UI plan & next steps (proposal)

- Surface API Key Vault under Settings ‚Üí Features ‚Üí "API Keys" (recommended). This avoids crowding top-level tabs while keeping features discoverable via a features submenu.
- Add a compact card in the main popup summarizing vault state (ON/OFF, X/10 FREE) with a link to the full Settings page.
- Implement Add/Edit/Delete modals for keys with format auto-detection and preview (masking in UI by default).
- Implement warn-first dialog flow: content script displays modal when keys are detected and sends user decision back to background (accept/redact/send anyway). This requires message plumbing between content script and service worker and a small modal UI component in the page context (or content script overlay).
- Add unit tests for detection and redact behavior and an integration e2e test for the warn-first flow (Playwright) before enabling warn-first by default.

### Impact considerations

- Stats & storage: Each key must track protectionCount and lastUsed; the Stats dashboard must be extended to show keys-protected by type.
- UX scalability: If we add many feature pages, use a single "Features" menu with feature pages as submenu items instead of adding top-level tabs for each feature. This keeps the popup compact and allows grouping (Security, Productivity, Integrations).
- Permissions & privacy: Keep all key data encrypted at rest and never transmitted. Warn users clearly when enabling auto-detection for "generic" patterns (may cause false positives).


### Success Criteria
- ‚è≥ Detects OpenAI keys in error logs
- ‚è≥ Shows warning before sending
- ‚è≥ User can proceed or cancel
- ‚è≥ Stats show protection count
- ‚è≥ FREE tier shows "X/10" counter
- ‚è≥ Upgrade prompt appears at limit

**Time: 1 week (foundation complete, integration pending)**

## Phase 7: AI Profile Fill (Week 8-9)
**Goal:** Let users generate fake profiles using the current AI chat (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini)

### Tasks (from feature_ai_profile_fill.md)
- [ ] Build AIProfileGenerator class
- [ ] Create service-specific prompts (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- [ ] Build consent modal UI ("We'll send a message to generate a profile - OK?")
- [ ] Implement ChatGPTInjector, ClaudeInjector, GeminiInjector

---

## Browser Compatibility

### Overview
AI PII Sanitizer is built for Chrome using Manifest V3. Expansion to other browsers follows this priority:

### Tier 1: Chromium Browsers (95-100% Compatible)
| Browser | Compatibility | Effort | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| **Chrome** | 100% ‚úÖ | 0 days | Primary development platform |
| **Edge** | 99% ‚úÖ | 0.5 days | Microsoft's Chromium fork, nearly identical API |
| **Opera** | 98% ‚úÖ | 0.5 days | Built on Chromium, minor UI differences |
| **Brave** | 98% ‚úÖ | 0.5 days | Privacy-focused Chromium, perfect audience fit |

**Strategy:** Minimal testing, submit to each store with same codebase.

### Tier 2: Firefox (70-80% Compatible)
| Browser | Compatibility | Effort | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| **Firefox** | 75% ‚ö†Ô∏è | 1-2 weeks | Uses WebExtensions API (similar but different) |

**Key Differences:**
- `chrome.*` ‚Üí `browser.*` namespace
- Manifest V3 support (added in Firefox 109+)
- Content script injection timing differences
- Storage API mostly compatible but quota limits differ

**Strategy:** Create Firefox-specific build with polyfills, test on 3-4 sites initially.

### Tier 3: Safari (60-70% Compatible)
| Browser | Compatibility | Effort | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| **Safari** | 60% ‚ö†Ô∏è | 3-4 weeks | Requires Xcode conversion + Apple Developer account ($99/year) |

**Key Challenges:**
- Must convert to Safari Web Extension format using Xcode
- Requires macOS for development and testing
- App Store submission process (1-2 weeks review)
- Some APIs limited or unavailable (e.g., declarativeNetRequest)
- Different security model (more restrictive CSP)

**Strategy:** Build only after 10,000+ Chrome installs and proven revenue.

### Tier 4: Mobile Browsers (20-30% Compatible)
| Platform | Compatibility | Effort | Notes |
|----------|---------------|--------|-------|
| **Chrome Android** | 30% ‚ö†Ô∏è | 2-3 months | Very limited extension support, would need separate app |
| **Firefox Android** | 40% ‚ö†Ô∏è | 2-3 months | Better extension support than Chrome, but still limited |
| **Safari iOS** | 20% ‚ö†Ô∏è | 3-4 months | Requires native iOS app wrapper, different architecture |

**Strategy:** Skip mobile until product-market fit proven on desktop. Consider native apps (React Native) if there's strong demand.

### Launch Priority
1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Chrome only
2. **Phase 2 (Month 4):** Edge, Opera, Brave (easy wins, same codebase)
3. **Phase 3 (Month 6+):** Firefox (if 5,000+ Chrome installs)
4. **Phase 4 (Month 12+):** Safari (if 10,000+ installs + $99/year justified)
5. **Phase 5 (Year 2+):** Mobile (if 50,000+ desktop installs)

## What Happens Next?

**I'll start with Phase 1: Profile Editor UI**

This is the quickest win - 3-4 days to build:
1. Modal component
2. Form with validation
3. Edit/delete functionality
4. Empty states

Then we move to production polish (icons, privacy policy, etc.)

Sound good? Want me to start building the profile editor modal now?
