# SaaS Chrome Extension Go-to-Market Strategy Framework

Here's a structured business strategy document with critical questions to refine your plan:

---

## I. PRODUCT-MARKET FIT VALIDATION

### Core Value Proposition
- **What specific problem does your extension solve?** (Be concrete - "saves X hours" or "prevents Y risk")
- **Who feels this pain most acutely?** (Individual professionals? Compliance officers? IT admins?)
- **What's your unfair advantage?** (750 tests suggest quality - but why can't competitors replicate this in 6 months?)
- **What makes someone switch from their current solution** (doing nothing, competitors, manual processes)?

### Positioning Questions
- **What's your one-sentence pitch for each segment?**
  - B2C individual: ___
  - Teams: ___
  - Enterprise: ___
- **What category are you in?** (Privacy tool? Productivity tool? Security compliance?)
- **Who are you NOT for?** (Clarity on who you exclude helps positioning)

---

## II. PHASE 1: B2C LAUNCH (Months 1-3)

### Pre-Launch Readiness (Next 2 Weeks)

**Product Questions:**
- **Is your onboarding flow under 2 minutes?** (Most users abandon if longer)
- **What's your "aha moment"?** (The first moment users see value - how fast do they reach it?)
- **Do you have usage analytics implemented?** (What features get used? Where do users drop off?)
- **What's your refund policy?** (Clear policy builds trust)

**Pricing Psychology:**
- **Why $5/month specifically?** (Have you tested $7 or $9? Price anchoring matters)
- **When will "early adopter pricing" end?** (Need a deadline or it's not credible)
- **What's included in the free tier/trial?** (Or are you doing paid-only from day 1?)
- **Annual discount structure?** ($50/year = 17% savings - is that compelling enough?)

**Launch Channel Priorities:**
- **Product Hunt:**
  - What day will you launch? (Avoid Fridays/Mondays)
  - Who's your Hunter? (Someone with followers helps)
  - Do you have 10+ people ready to upvote in the first hour?
  - What's your backup plan if you don't hit #1-3? (Still valuable for traffic)

- **Reddit:**
  - Have you been active in these communities for 30+ days? (Cold posts get destroyed)
  - What VALUE will you give before asking? (Share a free guide, not just your product)
  - Which 3 subreddits have the highest intent users?

- **LinkedIn Content:**
  - Do you have 500+ connections in your target audience?
  - What's your posting cadence? (3x/week minimum for algorithm)
  - What ratio of educational vs promotional? (80/20 rule)

- **AI Newsletter Sponsorships:**
  - Which 5 newsletters have your exact audience?
  - What's your budget per sponsorship? ($500-2000 typical)
  - What's your target CAC for these channels?

### Success Metrics (End of Month 3)

**Primary Goals:**
- How many paying users = success? (You said 100-500, but what's the minimum viable?)
- What's your target MRR? ($500? $2500?)
- **What metrics indicate product-market fit?**
  - Churn rate < ?%
  - NPS score > ?
  - % of users active weekly > ?%

**Learning Goals:**
- What 5 questions do you need answered about your users?
- What feature requests appear more than 10 times?
- Which acquisition channel has the lowest CAC?

---

## III. TEAMS TIER DEVELOPMENT

### Feature Scope Questions
- **What's the MINIMUM viable teams dashboard?**
  - Can you ship with just: billing portal + seat management + basic usage stats?
  - Or do you need collaboration features too?

- **Admin capabilities:**
  - What controls do admins ACTUALLY need day 1? (Add/remove users, view usage - anything else?)
  - Can policy enforcement wait until Phase 2?

- **Billing mechanics:**
  - Self-serve checkout or sales-assisted?
  - Monthly or annual only for teams?
  - How do you handle seat expansion mid-contract?

### Go-to-Market for Teams
- **Where do small teams (5-10 people) discover tools?**
  - Slack communities?
  - "Show HN"?
  - LinkedIn ads to specific job titles?

- **What's your positioning vs individual?**
  - "Shared knowledge base"?
  - "Compliance across team"?
  - "Centralized billing convenience"?

- **Pricing validation:**
  - Have you tested $8/seat vs $10/seat with target customers?
  - What's the price ceiling before they say "we'll just expense individual seats"?

## Next Steps

**To turn this into an actionable plan:**

1. **Answer the questions in Section X first** - these are your strategic anchors

2. **Fill out the 30-day tactical plan** with specific dates and deliverables

3. **Create a simple tracking dashboard:**
   - Weekly: Users, MRR, CAC by channel, churn
   - Monthly: Feature requests, NPS, runway remaining

4. **Schedule weekly reviews** with yourself (or accountability partner):
   - What worked? What didn't?
   - Adjust next week's priorities

5. **Book your Product Hunt launch date right now** - having a deadline forces execution

**The biggest risk in your plan isn't the strategy - it's execution discipline.** This framework only works if you actually track metrics, listen to customers, and adjust quickly.

What's your biggest uncertainty right now? Let's tackle that first.
