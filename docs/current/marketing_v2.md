# PromptBlocker: Marketing Strategy v2.0
**Revised for Enterprise-First B2B Approach**
**Target:** $10-50M acquisition in 24-36 months

## See marketing_v1_OLD.md for original consumer-focused strategy

## Executive Summary

**Core Insight:** Document upload protection is transformational, not incremental value.

**Target:** Professionals in regulated industries (legal, healthcare, finance)
**Strategy:** Enterprise-first B2B with prosumer freemium lead generation  
**Pricing:** $50-100/user/month (enterprise), $19/month (prosumer)
**Exit:** Zscaler/Cloudflare/Okta acquisition at 3-5x ARR

## Key Strategic Pivots from v1.0

| v1.0 (Consumer) | v2.0 (Enterprise) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Developer-first | Enterprise-first |
| $4.99/month | $50-100/user/month |
| Chat protection | Document upload |
| Side business | Fast-exit play |
| Product Hunt viral | LinkedIn outbound |

## Target Verticals

1. **Legal** - Can't upload contracts (client confidentiality)
2. **Healthcare** - Can't analyze clinical notes (HIPAA)
3. **Accounting** - Can't process tax returns (client financial data)

## Pricing Tiers

- **Free:** 5 docs/month (lead gen)
- **PRO:** $19/month unlimited (prosumer)
- **Team:** $49/user/month, min 5 seats (SMB)
- **Enterprise:** $50K+/year custom (500+ seats)

## 18-Month Roadmap

**Month 1-3:** Validation (5K users, 3 pilots at $500-1K/month)
**Month 4-9:** Enterprise MVP (10 customers, $120K ARR)  
**Month 10-18:** Fundraise & Scale ($2-3M seed, $1M ARR)
**Month 19-36:** Exit prep ($5-10M ARR, acquisition talks)

## Marketing Channels (Priority Order)

1. **LinkedIn Ads** - Target compliance officers, CTOs ($5K/month)
2. **Direct Outreach** - Cold email to 100 prospects/week
3. **Product Hunt** - Launch day visibility
4. **SEO Content** - Vertical landing pages (lawyers, doctors, CPAs)

## Critical Success Metrics

- **Month 3:** 30%+ users attempt document upload (validates use case)
- **Month 9:** 10 paying pilots, $10K MRR
- **Month 18:** $1M ARR, Series A ready or stay bootstrapped
- **Month 36:** $5-10M ARR, acquisition target

## Why This Works

**Speed advantage:** 6-12 month window before Microsoft/OpenAI add native filtering
**Cross-platform moat:** Works with all AI tools (not vendor-locked)
**Compliance budget:** Companies pay $50-150/user/year for security tools
**Acquisition value:** Cheaper for Zscaler/Cloudflare to buy than build

## Realistic Outcome

**Not a unicorn** - This is a $10-50M exit opportunity, not $100M+
**Fast execution required** - Must reach $5M ARR before big tech catches up
**Enterprise-only path** - Can't bootstrap to acquisition on $19/month pricing
