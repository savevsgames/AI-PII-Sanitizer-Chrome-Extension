# Marketing & Monetization Strategy

## Executive Summary

AI PII Sanitizer needs a dual-track approach:
1. **Free tier** - Build trust, grow user base, get reviews
2. **PRO tier** - Monetize power users and teams

The key insight: **Developers are our early adopters AND our trust validators**. Get devs using it, they'll vouch for it to non-technical users.

## Competitive Positioning
