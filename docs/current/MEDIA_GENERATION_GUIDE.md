Left side: shows the original placeholder text.

Right side: the text begins to glow and shift with encryption-like animation.

Scene 4 [10–15s]: On the right side, the placeholders morph with a soft digital shimmer:
“<PRIVATE_NAME>” → “<SAFE_NAME>”
“<PRIVATE_EMAIL>” → “<SAFE_EMAIL>”
The transformation emits a faint cyan glow and glass ripple effect, symbolizing anonymization.

Scene 5 [15–20s]: The new protected text stabilizes. A glowing green checkmark badge fades in with the caption:
“Protected by PromptBlocker.”
Camera zooms out, showing a clean UI framed by purple-to-cyan gradient light.
