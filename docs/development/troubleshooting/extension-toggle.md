# Disable Extension Fix - Complete Interception Stop

## The Problem You Identified

When the user clicked "Disable Extension", the extension would:
1. Set `settings.enabled = false` in storage ‚úÖ
2. Update badge to gray ‚úÖ
3. **BUT** continue blocking all fetch requests ‚ùå

This happened because `inject.js` was already loaded in the page and kept intercepting `window.fetch`, even though the config said "disabled".

## The Root Cause

**inject.js runs in page context** and cannot be "turned off" by the service worker. Once injected, it continues to intercept all fetch calls until the page reloads.

Setting `enabled = false` in storage only affects:
- The popup UI (shows as disabled)
- The badge color (gray)
- **NOT** the active fetch interception

## The Solution

When user clicks "Disable Extension", we now:

1. **Set flag:** `extensionDisabled = true` in inject.js
2. **Restore native fetch:** `window.fetch = nativeFetch`
3. **Pass through request:** Return original request immediately
4. **Stop all future interception:** Early return at top of fetch override

### Code Changes

**File:** `src/content/inject.js`

#### 1. Added Extension Disabled Flag (Line 19-20)

```javascript
// Extension disable flag - when true, stops all interception
let extensionDisabled = false;
```

#### 2. Early Return in Fetch Override (Lines 191-196)

```javascript
window.fetch = async function(...args) {
  // If extension was disabled, this override should never run
  // But if it does (race condition), pass through immediately
  if (extensionDisabled) {
    return nativeFetch.apply(this, args);
  }
  // ... rest of interception logic
```

**Why:** Prevents ANY interception attempts after disable

#### 3. Tab Focus Modal - Disable Handler (Lines 149-155)

```javascript
} else if (userAction === 'disable') {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è User chose disable - stopping all interception');
  extensionDisabled = true;
  // Restore original fetch to stop all interception
  window.fetch = nativeFetch;
  console.log('‚úÖ Extension disabled - fetch restored to native');
}
```

**Why:** When user switches to tab and sees modal, choosing disable stops ALL future fetch interception

#### 4. Request Blocking Modal - Disable Handler (Lines 237-245)

```javascript
} else if (userAction === 'disable') {
  // Extension disabled - restore native fetch and allow this request through
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è User chose disable - stopping all interception');
  extensionDisabled = true;
  window.fetch = nativeFetch;
  console.log('‚úÖ Extension disabled - passing through original request');

  // Allow this request to go through using native fetch
  return nativeFetch.apply(this, args);
}
```

**Why:** When user makes a request and sees modal, choosing disable:
1. Allows THIS request to proceed (no error)
2. Stops ALL future interception

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: User Switches to Tab (Not Protected)

1. Tab becomes visible ‚Üí Health check fails
2. Modal appears: "Extension Not Protected"
3. User clicks "Disable Extension"
4. **inject.js:**
   - Sets `extensionDisabled = true`
   - Restores `window.fetch = nativeFetch`
   - Logs: "Extension disabled - fetch restored to native"
5. **Result:** User can use ChatGPT normally, NO blocking, NO interception

### Scenario 2: User Makes Request (Not Protected)

1. User types message in ChatGPT
2. Clicks send ‚Üí fetch intercepted
3. Protection check fails ‚Üí Modal appears
4. User clicks "Disable Extension"
5. **inject.js:**
   - Sets `extensionDisabled = true`
   - Restores `window.fetch = nativeFetch`
   - Returns `nativeFetch.apply(this, args)` immediately
6. **Result:**
   - THIS request goes through successfully
   - ALL future requests pass through without interception

### Scenario 3: Future Requests After Disable

1. Extension already disabled (`extensionDisabled = true`)
2. User makes another ChatGPT request
3. **inject.js fetch override:**
   ```javascript
   if (extensionDisabled) {
     return nativeFetch.apply(this, args);
   }
   ```
4. **Result:** Immediate pass-through, NO interception logic runs

---

## Why This Works

### 1. Restoring `window.fetch`

```javascript
window.fetch = nativeFetch;
```

- **Before:** `window.fetch` points to our override function
- **After:** `window.fetch` points to original browser fetch
- **Effect:** Future calls to `fetch()` use native browser code

### 2. Early Return Guard

```javascript
if (extensionDisabled) {
  return nativeFetch.apply(this, args);
}
```

- **Purpose:** Handles race conditions where override still runs
- **Effect:** Even if old override runs, it immediately delegates to native
- **Safety:** Double-layer protection

### 3. Allowing Current Request

```javascript
return nativeFetch.apply(this, args);
```

- **Context:** User just clicked "Disable" while making request
- **Purpose:** Don't block the request that triggered the modal
- **Effect:** Request succeeds, ChatGPT responds normally

## User Experience Flow

### Before the Fix

```
User: *clicks send in ChatGPT*
Extension: üõë NOT PROTECTED modal
User: *clicks "Disable Extension"*
Extension: Settings updated, badge gray
ChatGPT: ‚ùå Request blocked!
User: *tries again*
ChatGPT: ‚ùå Request blocked!
User: *frustrated* "It's still blocking me!"
```

### After the Fix

```
User: *clicks send in ChatGPT*
Extension: üõë NOT PROTECTED modal
User: *clicks "Disable Extension"*
Extension: ‚úÖ Fetch restored to native
ChatGPT: ‚úÖ Message sent successfully!
User: *tries again*
ChatGPT: ‚úÖ Message sent successfully!
User: üòä "Perfect, I can use ChatGPT now"
```

## Technical Notes

### Why Not Just Stop Health Checks?

Stopping health checks wouldn't help because:
- The fetch override is already active
- It would still intercept and block requests
- Health checks are independent of interception

### Why Restore to `nativeFetch`?

We could also just set a flag and check it, but restoring:
- Completely removes our code from the path
- Better performance (no overhead)
- Cleaner console logs
- More obvious to developers inspecting

### What About Page Reload?

If user reloads the page:
- `inject.js` re-injects fresh
- `extensionDisabled` resets to `false`
- **BUT** if `settings.enabled = false` in storage, content.ts won't inject

So the flow is:
1. User disables ‚Üí `extensionDisabled = true` for current page
2. User reloads ‚Üí inject.js checks storage
3. If `enabled = false` in storage ‚Üí Don't inject at all

### Can They Re-enable?

**Current Page Session:**
- No, once disabled, stays disabled until page reload
- This is intentional - avoid confusion

**Future Page Loads:**
- Go to popup ‚Üí Enable extension
- Reload page ‚Üí Extension active again

üõë Showing NOT PROTECTED modal
‚ö†Ô∏è User clicked Disable Extension
‚úÖ Extension disabled
‚ö†Ô∏è User chose disable - stopping all interception
‚úÖ Extension disabled - fetch restored to native
```

### When User Disables (Request)

```
üîí AI PII Sanitizer: Intercepting https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/conversation
üõë BLOCKING REQUEST - Extension not protected
üõë Showing NOT PROTECTED modal
‚ö†Ô∏è User clicked Disable Extension
‚úÖ Extension disabled
‚ö†Ô∏è User chose disable - stopping all interception
‚úÖ Extension disabled - passing through original request
```

### Future Requests After Disable

```
(No logs - native fetch used directly)
```

## Summary

**What Changed:**
- Added `extensionDisabled` flag
- Restore `window.fetch = nativeFetch` when disabled
- Early return guard in fetch override
- Allow current request through when disabling

**What This Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Extension actually stops blocking after disable
- ‚úÖ User can use ChatGPT immediately
- ‚úÖ No more modal spam after disable
- ‚úÖ Badge shows correct state (gray)

**What Stays the Same:**
- Reload button still works (reloads page)
- Storage still updated (`enabled = false`)
- Badge still turns gray
- Popup still shows disabled state

**User Benefit:**
- **Before:** "Disable" didn't actually disable, kept blocking
- **After:** "Disable" immediately stops ALL interception

This matches user expectations perfectly! üéâ
