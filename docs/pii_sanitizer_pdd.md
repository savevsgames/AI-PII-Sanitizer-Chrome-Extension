# Product Design Document: AI PII Sanitizer Chrome Extension

## Executive Summary

**Product Name**: AI PII Sanitizer (working title: "PrivatePrompt", "AliasAI", or "SafeChat")

**Core Value Proposition**: Use AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) with real personal information context without exposing your actual PII to AI providers.

**How It Works**: Browser extension intercepts outgoing prompts to AI services, replaces real PII with contextually-appropriate aliases, then reverses the substitution in responses so users see their real data.

**Primary Use Case**: Privacy-conscious individuals and professionals in regulated industries (healthcare, legal, HR) who want AI assistance without compromising sensitive information.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

1. **Privacy Paralysis**: Users avoid using AI for truly useful tasks because they contain personal information
   - "Help me draft an email to my doctor about my symptoms" → Can't use real doctor's name
   - "Analyze this performance review for Sarah Chen" → Afraid to use actual names
   - "Plan a surprise party for my wife Emma" → Don't want this in AI training data

2. **Manual Redaction is Tedious**: 
   - Replacing names with "[PERSON_1]" breaks AI context and reasoning
   - Users forget to redact everything, leading to partial exposure
   - Copy-paste-edit workflow interrupts creative flow

3. **Enterprise Cannot Adopt AI**:
   - HIPAA, GDPR, attorney-client privilege prevent AI use with real data
   - Companies ban ChatGPT rather than risk leaks
   - Massive productivity opportunity locked behind compliance walls

4. **Existing Solutions Fall Short**:
   - **Corporate proxies**: Expensive, complex to set up, IT-managed only
   - **PII detection tools**: Only flag issues, don't solve them
   - **Local AI models**: Less capable, require technical setup, expensive hardware

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Alias Management

**User Interface**: Simple sidebar panel or popup with alias dictionary

**Capabilities**:
- Add name mappings: "Joe Smith" → "John Doe"
- Auto-suggest contextually-appropriate aliases (matching gender, ethnicity, length)
- Visual feedback when aliases are active
- Quick enable/disable toggle per conversation
- Export/import alias dictionary

**Smart Features** (Post-MVP):
- Detect relationships automatically ("my wife Sarah" → preserve relationship in alias)
- Suggest aliases based on usage patterns
- Auto-generate temporary aliases for one-off names

### 2. Request Interception

**Technical Approach**: Service Worker intercepts fetch/XHR to AI domains

**Supported Services** (MVP):
- ChatGPT (chat.openai.com)
- Claude (claude.ai)
- Gemini (gemini.google.com)

**Process Flow**:
1. User types prompt containing "Joe Smith"
2. Extension detects outgoing POST request
3. Parse request body, identify PII from alias dictionary
4. Replace "Joe Smith" → "John Doe" in request
5. Forward modified request to AI service
6. AI processes prompt with alias

### 3. Response Reversal

**Process Flow**:
1. AI responds with "John Doe" in completion
2. Extension intercepts response before rendering
3. Replace all instances of "John Doe" → "Joe Smith"
4. Render response with real names to user

**Edge Cases**:
- Partial matches ("John" vs "John Doe")
- Possessives ("John's wife" → "Joe's wife")
- Pronouns (maintain context: "he" still refers to Joe)
- New entities mentioned by AI (flag for user review)

### 4. Privacy Controls

**Transparency Features**:
- Visual indicator when sanitization is active (colored extension icon)
- "Show original" toggle to see what AI actually received
- Audit log of all substitutions made
- Clear warning when sending unprotected prompts

**User Control**:
- Whitelist mode: Only sanitize specific sites
- Per-conversation override: "Use real data for this chat"
- Emergency disable: One-click turn off for all sites

## User Experience

### First-Time Setup

1. Install extension from Chrome Web Store
2. Welcome screen explains concept with simple example
3. Guided setup: "Add your first alias"
   - Input: "Joe Smith" (your name)
   - Auto-suggest: "John Doe"
   - Preview: See how it works in sample prompt
4. Choose supported AI services to protect
5. Optional: Set up additional aliases (family, colleagues, places)

### Daily Usage Flow

**Scenario**: User wants AI to help draft sensitive email

1. Opens Claude.ai, extension icon shows green (protection active)
2. Types: "Help me write an email to Dr. Sarah Chen about my recurring headaches"
3. Sees yellow highlight on "Sarah Chen" as it's typed (indicating it will be sanitized)
4. Clicks send
5. Extension briefly shows toast: "1 name sanitized"
6. Claude responds with alias, extension reverses it, user sees "Dr. Chen" in response
7. User copies response, all names are correctly original

### Error Recovery

**Unknown Name Encountered**:
- AI response contains "Dr. Michael Roberts" (not in alias dictionary)
- Extension flags it with warning: "Unknown name detected in response"
- User options:
  - "Add to dictionary" (map to real name)
  - "Ignore for this conversation"
  - "It's fictional" (no action needed)

## Technical Architecture (High-Level)

### Extension Components

1. **Content Script**: Runs on AI chat pages, monitors input fields, highlights PII
2. **Service Worker**: Intercepts network requests/responses, performs substitution
3. **Popup UI**: Manages alias dictionary, shows stats, toggle protection
4. **Storage**: Chrome.storage.local for alias dictionary (encrypted)

### Data Flow

```
User Input → Content Script (detect PII) 
  → Service Worker (intercept POST) 
  → Alias Engine (substitute) 
  → AI Service
  
AI Response → Service Worker (intercept) 
  → Alias Engine (reverse) 
  → Content Script (render) 
  → User sees original names
```

### Key Technical Decisions

**Why Chrome Extension over Proxy/VPN**:
- Zero configuration for end users
- Works with any AI service (no API keys needed)
- No additional infrastructure costs
- Transparent to AI providers

**Why Client-Side over Server-Side**:
- No data leaves user's machine (besides what goes to AI)
- No hosting costs for MVP
- Better privacy (we never see user's PII)
- Faster (no round-trip to our servers)

## Non-Goals (For MVP)

❌ **Image/Document Analysis**: Only text-based chat initially
❌ **Multi-Language Support**: English only for MVP
❌ **Team/Enterprise Features**: Single-user only
❌ **Phone Numbers, Addresses, SSNs**: Names only initially
❌ **Perfect Accuracy**: 90% accuracy acceptable if user can fix errors
❌ **Voice Input**: Text only

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AI mentions alias in unexpected context | Medium | Implement context-aware reversal, allow manual override |
| Chrome updates break interception | High | Monitor Chrome dev channels, maintain compatibility layer |
| Users forget which aliases map to whom | Medium | Visual "cheat sheet" in popup, search function |
| Performance overhead on large responses | Low | Optimize regex matching, use Web Workers for processing |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| AI providers block the extension | High | Use standard browser APIs, avoid detection; emphasize this helps their GDPR compliance |
| Privacy paradox: Users don't care enough | High | Target regulated industries first where compliance is required |
| Free product expectations | Medium | Open source core, charge for enterprise features later |

### Legal/Compliance Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Users assume 100% protection | High | Clear disclaimers: "Reduces risk, doesn't eliminate it" |
| Violates AI ToS | Medium | Review each service's ToS, nothing explicitly blocks this |

## Why This Will Work

### Unique Advantages

1. **First-mover in specific niche**: General PII tools exist, but none target AI chat specifically with bidirectional aliasing
2. **Solves real pain**: Validated by enterprise AI bans and privacy discussions on every AI subreddit
3. **Easy adoption**: No API keys, no setup, just install and add aliases
4. **Imperfect beats nothing**: Even 90% protection is way better than raw-dogging PII into ChatGPT
5. **Network effects**: Users share alias dictionaries (anonymized) to help others
6. **B2B potential**: Once users love it, their employers will pay for team version

### Why Now

- AI adoption exploding, but privacy concerns holding back use cases
- GDPR/CCPA making companies paranoid about PII
- No good solutions exist for consumer/SMB market (enterprise has Microsoft Copilot, etc.)
- Chrome extension ecosystem mature and trusted by users

## Appendix: FAQ

**Q: Won't AI providers just block this?**
A: We use standard browser APIs. Blocking would affect all extensions. More likely they'll appreciate our help with their GDPR compliance.

**Q: What if the AI generates new information about the alias?**
A: We flag it for user review. If AI says "John Doe lives in Seattle," user maps that back to Joe if relevant.

**Q: Can I use this for my whole company?**
A: Not in MVP. Enterprise features (shared dictionaries, admin controls) are post-MVP.

**Q: Does this work with API access?**
A: No, extension intercepts browser requests only. API users need different solution.

**Q: What about images or uploaded documents?**
A: Text only for MVP. Future: OCR + sanitization for images.

**Q: Is my alias dictionary synced across devices?**
A: Not initially. Post-MVP: Optional cloud sync (encrypted).

**Q: What if I forget to turn it on?**
A: Extension active by default. You explicitly disable it, not enable it.

**Q: Can the extension see my passwords/credit cards?**
A: No. It only monitors chat interfaces, not all web traffic, and only processes text you explicitly send to AI services.
