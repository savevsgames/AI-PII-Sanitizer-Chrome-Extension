## Chrome Web Store Requirements

### 1. Developer Account Setup
**Cost:** $5 one-time fee

**Steps:**
1. Create Chrome Web Store Developer account: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole
2. Pay $5 fee (credit card required)
3. Verify email address
4. Enable 2FA (required for publishing)

**⚠️ Important:**
- Use a professional email (not personal Gmail)
- Account name shows on store listing (use "Your Company" not "John's Laptop")
- Cannot transfer ownership easily, so use business email

### 2. Manifest V3 Compliance
**Status:** ✅ Already done (we're using MV3)

**Required fields:**
```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,  // Must be 3 (MV2 deprecated Jan 2024)
  "name": "AI PII Sanitizer",  // Max 45 characters
  "version": "1.0.0",  // Must increment with each update
  "description": "Protect your personal information when using AI tools like ChatGPT",  // Max 132 chars
  "icons": {  // REQUIRED - must have all 4 sizes
    "16": "icons/icon16.png",
    "48": "icons/icon48.png",
    "128": "icons/icon128.png",
    "512": "icons/icon512.png"  // Not in manifest, but required for store listing
  },
  "permissions": [  // Must justify EVERY permission
    "storage",
    "activeTab"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [  // Must justify EVERY domain
    "https://chat.openai.com/*",
    "https://claude.ai/*",
    "https://gemini.google.com/*"
  ]
}
```

**Icon Requirements:**
- 16x16, 48x48, 128x128 (in manifest)
- 512x512 (for store listing)
- PNG format, transparent background
- No jagged edges (use proper anti-aliasing)
- Recognizable at 16px (don't use tiny text)

**Tools to create icons:**
- Figma (free)
- Canva (free)
- Photoshop (paid)
- AI generator: "shield icon for privacy extension, minimalist, flat design"

### 3. Single Purpose Policy
**Rule:** Extension must do ONE thing clearly stated in description.

**Our single purpose:**
"Protect personal information (PII) when using AI chat services by replacing real data with safe aliases."

**❌ Cannot add later:**
- Unrelated features (e.g., "also blocks ads")
- Multiple purposes (e.g., "PII protection AND grammar checking")

**✅ Can add later:**
- Related features (e.g., "support more AI services")
- Improvements to core purpose (e.g., "better PII detection")

### 4. Permissions Justification
**Rule:** Every permission must be explained on store listing.

**Our permissions:**
| Permission | Justification |
|------------|---------------|
| `storage` | Store user's identity profiles and aliases locally with encryption |
| `activeTab` | Detect when user is on ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini to activate protection |
| `host_permissions` (chatgpt) | Intercept and modify requests to replace PII before sending |
| `host_permissions` (claude) | Intercept and modify requests to replace PII before sending |
| `host_permissions` (gemini) | Intercept and modify requests to replace PII before sending |

**⚠️ Red Flags (avoid):**
- `<all_urls>` - Triggers manual review
- `webRequest` without clear justification
- `cookies` - Often flagged as overreach
- `tabs` - Use `activeTab` instead when possible

### 5. Store Listing Assets

**Required:**
- **Name:** "AI PII Sanitizer" (max 45 chars)
- **Description:** Max 132 characters (appears in search results)
  - "Protect your personal information when using ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI tools. Keep your data private with automatic PII substitution."
- **Detailed Description:** Up to 16,000 characters (markdown supported)
- **Category:** Primary: "Productivity", Secondary: "Privacy"
- **Language:** English (can add more later)
- **Screenshots:** 1-5 images (1280x800 or 640x400)
  - Show the popup UI
  - Show it working on ChatGPT
  - Show before/after (real PII → alias)
  - Annotate with arrows/text to explain
- **Promotional Tile:** 440x280 (optional but recommended)
- **Promotional video:** YouTube URL (optional but boosts conversions)

**Screenshot Best Practices:**
- Use high-quality mockups (not raw Chrome screenshots)
- Add captions explaining what's happening
- Show the VALUE (protected privacy) not just features
- Tools: Shottr, CleanShot X, Figma

### 6. Privacy Practices Disclosure
**New Requirement (2024):** Must disclose data handling practices

**Questions Chrome will ask:**
1. **Does your extension handle personal data?**
   - ✅ Yes (we handle name, email, phone, address)

2. **Is data encrypted in transit and at rest?**
   - ✅ Yes (AES-256-GCM for local storage, HTTPS for any network)

3. **Do you share data with third parties?**
   - ✅ No (all data stays local)

4. **Can users delete their data?**
   - ✅ Yes (clear all button + uninstall removes everything)

5. **Is data used for purposes beyond core functionality?**
   - ✅ No (no tracking, no analytics on user PII)

**⚠️ Important:**
- Lying here = instant ban
- Must match your Privacy Policy exactly
- Audited by Google (they check the code)

---

## Privacy & Legal Requirements

### 1. Privacy Policy (REQUIRED)
**Must have before publishing to store.**

**Required sections:**
1. **What data we collect**
   - Identity profiles (name, email, phone, address, etc.)
   - Usage statistics (substitution count, service used)
   - Activity logs (last 100 interceptions)

2. **How we use data**
   - Perform PII substitution
   - Show statistics in popup
   - Debugging (activity log)
   - No tracking, no selling, no sharing

3. **Where data is stored**
   - Locally on user's device (chrome.storage.local)
   - Encrypted with AES-256-GCM
   - Never sent to our servers
   - Never shared with third parties

4. **User rights**
   - Access: View all data in popup
   - Export: Download profiles and stats
   - Delete: Clear all data button
   - Uninstall: Removes all data

5. **Contact info**
   - Email: privacy@yourextension.com
   - Response time: 48 hours

**Where to host:**
- ✅ GitHub Pages (free)
- ✅ yourextension.com/privacy
- ❌ Google Docs (looks unprofessional)
- ❌ Pastebin (not trusted)

**Templates:**
- https://www.termsfeed.com/privacy-policy-generator/ (free)
- https://app.termly.io/ (free tier available)
- Lawyer review: $500-1k (recommended for enterprise tier)

**Link in manifest:**
```json
{
  "homepage_url": "https://yourextension.com/privacy"
}
```

### 2. Terms of Service (RECOMMENDED)
**Not required by Chrome, but needed for PRO tier (payments).**

**Required sections:**
1. **Acceptance of terms**
2. **User responsibilities** (don't use for illegal purposes)
3. **Intellectual property** (who owns what)
4. **Limitation of liability** (we're not responsible if it fails)
5. **Termination** (we can ban abusive users)
6. **Governing law** (which country's laws apply)

**Template:** https://www.termsfeed.com/terms-service-generator/

### 3. GDPR Compliance
**Required if you have EU users (you will).**

**Key requirements:**
1. **Lawful basis for processing**
   - ✅ Legitimate interest (providing the service)
   - ✅ User consent (they installed it)

2. **Data minimization**
   - ✅ Only collect what's needed
   - ✅ Don't send data to servers
   - ✅ Delete when no longer needed

3. **Right to access**
   - ✅ Export button for all data

4. **Right to deletion ("Right to be forgotten")**
   - ✅ Clear all data button
   - ✅ Uninstall removes everything

5. **Data breach notification**
   - Must notify users within 72 hours if breach occurs
   - Must notify supervisory authority

**How to comply:**
- Privacy Policy mentions GDPR rights
- Email: gdpr@yourextension.com
- Process: User emails → you delete their data → confirm within 30 days

**GDPR fines:** Up to €20M or 4% of revenue (scary, but only if you're malicious)

### 4. CCPA Compliance (California Privacy Law)
**Similar to GDPR, easier to comply.**

**Key requirements:**
1. Disclose what data you collect (Privacy Policy ✅)
2. Allow users to delete data (Clear button ✅)
3. Don't sell user data (we don't ✅)

**How to comply:**
- Add "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link to privacy policy
- Since we don't sell data, just state: "We do not sell your personal information."

---

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
**Prevents XSS attacks.**

**Our CSP (in manifest.json):**
```json
{
  "content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'"
  }
}
```

**What this does:**
- Only allows scripts from our extension (no inline scripts)
- Blocks `eval()` (dangerous)
- Blocks external scripts (no CDN injection attacks)

**⚠️ Common mistake:**
- Don't use `'unsafe-eval'` or `'unsafe-inline'` (Chrome will reject)

### 2. Encryption
**Status:** ✅ Already implemented (AES-256-GCM)

**Best practices:**
- ✅ Encrypt sensitive data (profiles with real PII)
- ✅ Use strong algorithm (AES-256-GCM, not AES-ECB)
- ✅ Don't hardcode keys (derive from user input or generate randomly)
- ❌ Don't roll your own crypto (use Web Crypto API)

**Our implementation:**
```typescript
// src/lib/encryption.ts - already using Web Crypto API ✅
```

### 3. Input Validation
**Prevent injection attacks.**

**What to validate:**
- User-entered PII (name, email, phone)
- Custom regex patterns (in PRO tier)
- Imported profile JSON

**How to validate:**
```typescript
// Email validation
function isValidEmail(email: string): boolean {
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return regex.test(email);
}

// Sanitize custom regex (prevent ReDoS attacks)
function sanitizeRegex(pattern: string): string {
  // Check for catastrophic backtracking patterns
  // Limit length
  if (pattern.length > 500) throw new Error('Regex too long');
  return pattern;
}
```

### 4. Secure Communication
**All network requests must use HTTPS.**

**Our status:**
- ✅ No network requests currently (all local)
- ⚠️ Future PRO tier: API calls for team sync must use HTTPS

**If adding backend:**
- Use HTTPS only (TLS 1.2+)
- Certificate pinning (optional, but recommended)
- Auth tokens in headers (not URL params)

### 5. Code Obfuscation
**Make it harder to reverse-engineer.**

**Options:**
1. **Webpack production mode** ✅ (we're doing this)
   - Minifies code
   - Removes comments
   - Uglifies variable names

2. **Advanced obfuscation** (optional)
   - javascript-obfuscator
   - ProGuard (for Java/Kotlin)

**⚠️ Trade-off:**
- More obfuscation = harder to audit (less trust)
- For privacy extension, transparency > obfuscation
- Only obfuscate PRO features (keep core open-source)

### 6. Dependency Auditing
**Ensure no vulnerable packages.**

**Run before every release:**
```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

**Check for:**
- High/Critical vulnerabilities
- Unmaintained packages (last update >2 years ago)
- Packages with few downloads (could be malicious)

**Tools:**
- Snyk (free tier available)
- GitHub Dependabot (free, auto-creates PRs)
- Socket.dev (detects malicious packages)

### 7. No Phone-Home Analytics
**Don't track users without consent.**

**❌ Avoid:**
- Google Analytics
- Mixpanel
- Sentry error tracking (without opt-in)

**✅ Alternative:**
- No analytics (trust builds faster)
- Privacy-friendly: Plausible Analytics (GDPR compliant)
- Self-hosted: Umami, Matomo

**If you must track:**
- Make it opt-in (checkbox in settings)
- Anonymize IP addresses
- Don't track PII (obviously!)

---

## Code Quality & Testing

### 1. Linting & Formatting
**Consistent code style.**

**Tools:**
- ESLint (already configured ✅)
- Prettier (auto-format)
- TypeScript strict mode

**Run before commit:**
```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### 2. Unit Tests
**Test core logic.**

**What to test:**
- `aliasEngine.substitute()` with various inputs
- `encrypt()` and `decrypt()` roundtrip
- `storage.createProfile()` edge cases
- PII detection regex patterns

**Framework:**
- Jest (popular, easy setup)
- Vitest (faster, modern)

**Example:**
```typescript
// tests/aliasEngine.test.ts
test('substitute name in text', () => {
  const engine = new AliasEngine(profiles);
  const result = engine.substitute('My name is Greg Barker', 'encode');
  expect(result.text).toBe('My name is John Smith');
  expect(result.substitutions).toHaveLength(1);
});
```

**Coverage goal:** 80%+ for core logic

### 3. Integration Tests
**Test end-to-end flow.**

**What to test:**
- Content script intercepts ChatGPT request
- Background script substitutes PII
- Response is decoded correctly
- UI updates with correct stats

**Tools:**
- Puppeteer (Chrome automation)
- Playwright (multi-browser)

**Example:**
```javascript
// tests/e2e.test.js
test('ChatGPT substitution works', async () => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://chat.openai.com');
  await page.type('[contenteditable]', 'My email is greg@test.com');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // Check network request was modified
  const requests = await page._client.send('Network.getAllCookies');
  // Assert PII was replaced
});
```

### 4. Manual Testing Checklist
**Before every release.**

| Test | Expected Result | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|
| Install extension | No errors in console | ⬜ |
| Create profile | Appears in list | ⬜ |
| Send ChatGPT message with PII | PII replaced in network tab | ⬜ |
| Receive ChatGPT response | Alias decoded to real PII | ⬜ |
| Check stats | Counter increments | ⬜ |
| Toggle minimal mode | Switches correctly | ⬜ |
| Export profiles | Downloads JSON file | ⬜ |
| Clear all data | Everything deleted | ⬜ |
| Uninstall extension | chrome.storage cleared | ⬜ |
| Reload extension | Profiles persist | ⬜ |
| Test on Claude | Works same as ChatGPT | ⬜ |
| Test on Gemini | Works same as ChatGPT | ⬜ |

### 5. Browser Compatibility
**Test on all Chromium browsers.**

| Browser | Version | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Chrome | Latest (120+) | ⬜ |
| Edge | Latest | ⬜ |
| Brave | Latest | ⬜ |
| Opera | Latest | ⬜ |

**Note:** Manifest V3 is Chromium-only (no Firefox support yet)

## Common Rejection Reasons

### Top 10 Reasons Chrome Rejects Extensions

1. **Misleading description**
   - ❌ "Best AI tool ever" (too vague)
   - ✅ "Protect personal information in AI chat tools"

2. **Unnecessary permissions**
   - ❌ Requesting `<all_urls>` when you only need 3 domains
   - ✅ Only request what you need

3. **Keyword stuffing**
   - ❌ "AI ChatGPT Claude Gemini privacy security PII protection anonymity..."
   - ✅ Natural description with relevant keywords

4. **Missing Privacy Policy**
   - ❌ No link provided
   - ✅ Link in manifest `homepage_url` and store listing

5. **Icon quality issues**
   - ❌ Blurry, pixelated, or copyrighted images
   - ✅ Original, high-quality icons

6. **Single purpose violation**
   - ❌ "PII protection AND ad blocking AND password manager"
   - ✅ One clear purpose

7. **Minified code without source**
   - ❌ Obfuscated code with no explanation
   - ✅ Minified for production, but still readable

8. **Deceptive behavior**
   - ❌ Collecting data without disclosure
   - ✅ Transparent about what you do

9. **Copyright infringement**
   - ❌ Using "ChatGPT" in extension name
   - ✅ "AI PII Sanitizer for ChatGPT" (okay in description)

10. **Malware/Spyware**
    - ❌ Sending data to unknown servers
    - ✅ Open source, auditable code

### How to Avoid Rejection
1. **Read the policies:** https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/
2. **Check examples:** Look at similar approved extensions
3. **Be transparent:** Explain everything clearly
4. **Test thoroughly:** No crashes, no errors
5. **Respond quickly:** If rejected, fix and resubmit within 7 days

### If Rejected
1. **Read rejection email carefully** - Tells you exactly what's wrong
2. **Fix the issue** - Don't argue, just fix it
3. **Resubmit with explanation** - "Changed X to comply with Y policy"
4. **Wait 1-3 days** - Faster on resubmission
5. **Appeal if unfair** - developer-support@google.com (rare)
