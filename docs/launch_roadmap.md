# Launch Roadmap: Free ‚Üí Users ‚Üí PRO

## Philosophy

**Ship ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Scale**

Don't build features no one uses. Get free tier perfect, share with devs, build trust, then add PRO features based on real user feedback.

### Test Matrix

| Claude | claude.ai | Send PII, verify substitution | ‚è≥ Ready |
| Gemini | gemini.google.com | Send PII, verify substitution | ‚è≥ Ready |
| Perplexity | perplexity.ai | Send PII, verify substitution | ‚è≥ Ready |
| Poe | poe.com | Send PII, verify substitution | ‚è≥ Ready |
| Copilot | copilot.microsoft.com | Send PII, verify substitution | ‚è≥ Ready |
| You.com | you.com | Send PII, verify substitution | ‚è≥ Ready |

### For Each Service
1. Visit service
2. Create new conversation
3. Send: "My name is Greg Barker and email is greg@test.com"
4. Open Network tab ‚Üí Check request has "John Smith" and "john@example.com"
5. Verify response decoded correctly (shows "Greg Barker")
6. Check Debug Console ‚Üí Service name logged correctly
7. Check Stats ‚Üí Service counter incremented

### Known Issues to Fix
- [ ] Service detection might fail on some (URL pattern wrong)

## Phase 5: Image Scanning (Week 6+)
**Goal:** Add PRO killer feature (but only after users validate core product)

**SKIP FOR INITIAL LAUNCH**

Build this only if:
- We have 100+ users requesting it

## Key Decisions Needed

Pick one and commit. Changing later is painful.

**Vote:**
- [ ] Keep "AI PII Sanitizer"
- [ ] PrivacyShield
- [ ] SafePrompt
- [ ] Other: __________

### 2. Domain
Register yourname.com for landing page

### 3. Support Email
Set up support@yourname.com (or use Gmail alias)

### 4. Pricing (decide now, launch later)
- Free: Basic PII protection (name, email, phone)
- PRO: API key vault + advanced PII + analytics ($4.99/mo)
- Enterprise: Team management + SSO (custom pricing)

**Alternative:** Launch 100% free, add PRO tier after 1,000 users validate the product.

## What Happens Next?

**I'll start with Phase 1: Profile Editor UI**

This is the quickest win - 3-4 days to build:
1. Modal component
2. Form with validation
3. Edit/delete functionality
4. Empty states

Then we move to production polish (icons, privacy policy, etc.)

Sound good? Want me to start building the profile editor modal now?
