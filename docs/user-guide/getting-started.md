# Getting Started with PromptBlocker

Welcome to PromptBlocker! This guide will help you set up and start protecting your privacy in just a few minutes.

## üéØ What is PromptBlocker?

PromptBlocker protects your personal information when using AI chat services like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. It automatically replaces your real information with aliases before sending messages to AI servers.

**Example:**
- You type: "My name is John Smith and my email is john@example.com"
- AI receives: "My name is Alex Johnson and my email is alex@demo.com"
- AI responds to "Alex Johnson"
- You see the response with your real name back

**Benefits:**
- üîí Privacy protection - AI never sees your real information
- üé≠ Multiple identities - Create different profiles for different purposes
- üõ°Ô∏è Secure - All data encrypted and stored locally
- üöÄ Easy - Works automatically once set up

## üéì Understanding Profiles

### What is a Profile?

A profile is a set of real‚Üíalias mappings. You can create multiple profiles for different purposes:

**Examples:**
- **Work Profile:** Professional alias for work-related AI assistance
- **Personal Profile:** Casual alias for personal projects
- **Learning Profile:** Student alias for educational use
- **Testing Profile:** Throwaway information for testing

### Profile Fields

You can protect these types of information:

| Field | Example Real | Example Alias |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Name | John Smith | Alex Johnson |
| Email | john@company.com | alex@demo.com |
| Phone | +1-555-123-4567 | +1-555-999-0000 |
| Address | 123 Main St, NYC | 456 Demo Ave, SF |

**Pro Tip:** You don't need to fill in all fields - only add what you use!

### Enabling/Disabling Profiles

- **Green toggle** = Profile active (will substitute PII)
- **Gray toggle** = Profile inactive (no substitution)

You can have multiple profiles, but only enabled ones will be used.

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Status

### Badge Colors

The PromptBlocker badge shows your current protection status:

| Badge | Status | Meaning |

### What to Do if Badge is Red?

1. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. Wait 2-3 seconds for extension to load

4. If still red, click the PromptBlocker icon to see why

**Common Reasons:**

- Extension was just updated (refresh page)
- Content script failed to inject (check console for errors)

### "Not Protected" Modal

If you switch to an AI service tab and the badge is red, you'll see a modal:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è You Are Not Protected

Your personal information may be exposed.
Please refresh this page to enable protection.

[Refresh Page] [Disable Extension]
```
