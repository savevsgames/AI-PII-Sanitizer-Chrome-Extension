# Phase 3 Complete: API Key Vault & Custom Redaction Rules

**Completion Date:** January 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Phase 3 delivered two major features that significantly enhance the extension's privacy protection capabilities:
1. **API Key Vault** - Protect sensitive API keys from accidental exposure
2. **Custom Redaction Rules** - Create regex-based patterns for domain-specific PII

Both features are now fully functional, tested, and integrated into the extension.

## 🔒 API Key Vault

### Features Implemented

#### Core Functionality
- ✅ Store and encrypt API keys locally
- ✅ Auto-detect 6 common API key formats:
  - OpenAI (sk-...)
  - Anthropic Claude (sk-ant-...)
  - Google/Gemini (AIza...)
  - GitHub (ghp_..., gho_..., ghs_...)
  - AWS (AKIA..., ASIA...)
  - Stripe (sk_live_..., sk_test_...)
- ✅ Custom pattern support for proprietary API keys
- ✅ Protection modes:
  - **Auto-Redact**: Automatically block keys (default)
  - **Warn-First**: Show warning before blocking
  - **Log-Only**: Log detections without blocking

#### UI Components
- ✅ Feature card in Features hub
- ✅ Key management interface
- ✅ Add/edit/delete key modals
- ✅ Key masking (show last 4 characters)
- ✅ Project/name labeling for organization
- ✅ Usage stats (protection count per key)
- ✅ Empty state with onboarding

#### Technical Implementation
- **Files Created:**
  - `src/lib/apiKeyDetector.ts` (149 lines) - Detection engine
  - `src/popup/components/apiKeyVault.ts` (387 lines) - UI component
  - `src/popup/components/apiKeyModal.ts` (300 lines) - Add/edit modal
  - `src/popup/styles/api-keys.css` (312 lines) - Styling

- **Integration Points:**
  - Service worker request interception
  - Chrome API message passing
  - Storage manager encryption
  - Activity log tracking

### Testing Results
- ✅ OpenAI key detection and redaction
- ✅ Multiple key formats detected simultaneously
- ✅ Keys properly masked in UI
- ✅ Protection count increments correctly
- ✅ Modal validation prevents duplicate keys

## 🎯 Custom Redaction Rules

### Features Implemented

#### Core Functionality
- ✅ Regex-based pattern matching engine
- ✅ Priority-based rule execution (0-100, higher runs first)
- ✅ Category organization (PII, Financial, Medical, Custom)
- ✅ Capture group support ($1, $2, $&)
- ✅ Match count tracking per rule
- ✅ Enable/disable toggle per rule
- ✅ Pattern validation with error messages

#### Pre-Built Templates (10)
1. ✅ US Social Security Number (XXX-XX-XXXX)
2. ✅ Credit Card Number (16 digits with spaces/dashes)
3. ✅ US Phone Number (various formats)
4. ✅ IP Address (IPv4)
5. ✅ Employee ID (EMP-XXXXX)
6. ✅ Medical Record Number (MRN-XXXXXXX)
7. ✅ Driver License Number (DL-XXXXXXXX)
8. ✅ Bank Account Number (8-12 digits)
9. ✅ Passport Number (1-2 letters + 7-9 digits)
10. ✅ Date of Birth (DOB: MM/DD/YYYY)

#### UI Components
- ✅ **Expandable dropdown form** - Replaced modal with clean dropdown at top of page
- ✅ Custom tab - Manual rule creation
- ✅ Templates tab - One-click template application
- ✅ Live pattern testing - Test regex before saving
- ✅ Rule cards - Display with edit/delete/test/toggle
- ✅ Stats dashboard - Active rules and total matches
- ✅ Category grouping - Organized by PII/Financial/Medical/Custom
- ✅ Empty state with CTA

#### Technical Implementation
- **Files Created:**
  - `src/lib/redactionEngine.ts` (228 lines) - Pattern matching engine
  - `src/lib/ruleTemplates.ts` (169 lines) - 10 preset templates
  - `src/popup/components/customRulesUI.ts` (926 lines) - Complete UI
  - `src/popup/styles/custom-rules.css` (447 lines) - Full styling

- **Integration Points:**
  - Runs after PII substitution, before API key detection
  - Service worker message handlers (5 new operations)
  - Storage manager CRUD operations
  - Chrome API integration

### Testing Results
- ✅ Credit card number (9876 6785 5667 4154) successfully redacted
- ✅ Pattern validation catches invalid regex
- ✅ Live testing shows matches before saving
- ✅ Rules save and persist correctly
- ✅ UI refreshes immediately after save
- ✅ Priority ordering works correctly
- ✅ Templates populate form correctly

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Issue 1: Custom Rules Not Saving/Rendering
**Problem**: Rules were being saved but not appearing in UI
**Root Cause**: Missing `renderCustomRules()` call after save
**Fix**: Added re-render after config load in `handleSaveRule()`
**File**: `src/popup/components/customRulesUI.ts:776-778`

### Issue 2: PRO Upgrade Warning Showing for FREE Feature
**Problem**: Upgrade warning appeared even though feature was set to FREE tier
**Root Cause**: Tier check in `renderCustomRules()` checking user account tier
**Fix**: Commented out tier check during testing phase
**File**: `src/popup/components/customRulesUI.ts:27-35`

### Issue 3: CSP Violation - Inline onclick Handler
**Problem**: Console error about inline event handler in upgrade button
**Root Cause**: Used `onclick="..."` attribute in HTML
**Fix**: Changed to `id="customRulesUpgradeBtn"` with proper event listener
**File**: `src/popup/components/featuresTab.ts:316`

### Issue 4: Custom Rules CSS Not Loading
**Problem**: Rules UI had no styling
**Root Cause**: Missing CSS import in popup HTML
**Fix**: Added `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/custom-rules.css">`
**File**: `src/popup/popup-v2.html:8`

### Issue 5: TypeScript Errors - Unused Variables
**Problem**: Build failed due to unused variable declarations
**Root Cause**: Declared variables in refactored code but didn't remove unused ones
**Fix**: Removed unused `addRuleForm`, `toggleIcon`, `userTier` declarations
**Files**: `src/popup/components/customRulesUI.ts`, `src/background/serviceWorker.ts`

### Issue 6: Template Icon Property Missing
**Problem**: Build error - `Property 'icon' does not exist on type 'RuleTemplate'`
**Root Cause**: Templates don't have icon property in interface
**Fix**: Added inline category icons in `renderTemplates()` function
**File**: `src/popup/components/customRulesUI.ts:877-883`

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Pattern Compilation
- Regex patterns compiled once and cached in Map
- Rules sorted by priority only once per request
- Minimal overhead on request interception

### Storage
- Rules and keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Stored in chrome.storage.local (faster than sync)
- No network calls for key/rule operations

### UI Rendering
- Category grouping reduces DOM nodes
- Event delegation for rule cards
- Debounced pattern testing

---

## 📝 Known Limitations

### API Key Vault
1. **Detection Accuracy**: Generic patterns may have false positives
2. **Custom Patterns**: Users must know regex syntax
3. **Key Rotation**: No automatic expiration/rotation reminders

### Custom Rules
1. **Regex Complexity**: Complex patterns may slow down processing
2. **Pattern Conflicts**: Multiple overlapping rules may cause issues
3. **Test Coverage**: No automated tests for redaction engine yet

### Both Features
1. **FREE vs PRO Tiers**: Currently both features are FREE (tier logic commented out)
2. **Mobile Support**: Not tested on Chrome Android
3. **Performance**: Large number of rules/keys may impact performance
