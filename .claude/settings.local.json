Refactor popup into components (Week 1)\n2. Implement alias variations as PRO feature (Week 2)\n3. Fix security issues (XSS, localStorage)\n4. Change license to Apache 2.0 (requires attribution)\n5. Rebrand to Pseudonize (~30 files affected)\n\n**Privacy Policy Location:** Keep in root ✅\n**License:** Apache 2.0 recommended (enterprise-ready, requires credit)\n\n🤖 Generated with Claude Code\nhttps://claude.com/claude-code\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
