## Realistic Numbers (Month 12 Goals)

### User Growth
- Free users: 1,000 total (100/month new)
- PRO users ($19/month): 100 total (10/month new)
- Team users ($49/user/month): 50 users across 10 companies
- **Total MRR:** (100 × $19) + (50 × $49) = $1,900 + $2,450 = **~$4,400 MRR**

Wait, that's way below $100K MRR... Let me recalculate with enterprise focus:

### Enterprise-Focused Numbers
- Free users: 1,000 total (lead gen)
- PRO users ($19/month): 50 (prosumer segment)
- Team deals (5-10 users): 20 companies × 7.5 avg users × $49 = **$7,350 MRR**
- Enterprise deals (50-500 users): 5 companies × 100 avg users × $50 = **$25,000 MRR**
- **Total MRR:** $950 + $7,350 + $25,000 = **~$33,300 MRR** ($400K ARR)

**If you hit $400K ARR by Month 12, you're seed-fundable ($2-3M at $10-15M valuation).**

---

## Budget Allocation (Month 12 Steady State)

| Category | Monthly Spend | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Team Salaries** | $15K-20K | VA + Content + Ads + SDR |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | $15K | Enterprise lead gen |
| **Google Ads** | $10K | Inbound traffic |
| **Retargeting** | $5K | Convert warm leads |
| **Tools & Software** | $2K | CRM, email, analytics, ad tools |
| **Content Production** | $1K | Freelance writers, design |
| **User Incentives** | $1K | Interview stipends, referrals |
| **TOTAL** | **$49K-54K/month** | **$600K-650K/year burn** |

**Revenue Needed to Break Even:** $54K MRR = $650K ARR

**Reality Check:** You'll likely be at $400K ARR by Month 12, burning $600K/year = **need to raise $1-2M seed to fund next 18-24 months.**

---

## Fundraising Strategy (Months 10-12)

**When to raise:** Once you hit $200K-400K ARR with 30%+ MoM growth

**How much:** $2-3M seed at $10-15M post-money valuation

**Investor pitch:**
- "AI compliance layer for regulated industries"
- "$5-10B TAM (500M knowledge workers × $10-20/month)"
- "30%+ of users upload documents daily (high engagement)"
- "$400K ARR with 5 enterprise customers ($50K+ ACV)"
- "Team: Technical founder + proven go-to-market hires"

**Use of funds:**
- 50% sales & marketing (hire 5 more SDRs + 2 AEs)
- 30% product (hire 2 engineers)
- 20% ops & overhead

**Target close date:** Month 12 (end of Phase 2)

---

## Phase 2 → Phase 3 Transition Criteria

### ✅ **GO TO PHASE 3** (Scale with funding)
- $400K+ ARR
- 30%+ MoM growth for 3 consecutive months
- 5+ enterprise customers ($50K+ ACV each)
- $2M+ seed raised
- Team of 5-10 people

### ⚠️ **EXTEND PHASE 2** (Not ready yet)
- $200K-400K ARR (growing but not fast enough)
- <20% MoM growth (need to optimize GTM motion)
- <3 enterprise customers (not enough proof of repeatability)

### ❌ **PIVOT OR WIND DOWN**
- <$100K ARR after 12 months of small team effort
- Negative unit economics (CAC > LTV)
- No enterprise traction (only prosumers)

---

## Time Investment (You as Founder)

**Your role shifts from maker → manager:**

| Activity | Hours/Week | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Product strategy + roadmap | 10 hours | Still technical, but less coding |
| Sales calls + demos | 10 hours | Close enterprise deals yourself |
| Team management | 5 hours | 1-on-1s, hiring, planning |
| Fundraising (Months 10-12) | 10 hours | Pitch deck, investor meetings |
| **TOTAL** | **35 hours/week** | Less execution, more strategy |

**Delegate:** Customer support, content writing, ad management, user onboarding

**Keep:** Enterprise sales, product vision, fundraising

---

## Common Pitfalls (Avoid These)

❌ **Hiring too fast**
- Don't hire SDR before you have content + case studies
- Don't hire engineers before product-market fit

❌ **Burning too much on ads**
- Start with $5K/month, not $30K
- Only scale if CAC:LTV ratio is >3:1

❌ **Ignoring churn**
- If >5% monthly churn, stop marketing and fix product
- High churn = weak product-market fit

❌ **Fundraising too early**
- VCs want $200K+ ARR minimum for seed
- Don't waste 3 months fundraising at $50K ARR

❌ **Neglecting existing customers**
- 10 happy customers > 100 lukewarm users
- Focus on retention + expansion over new acquisition

---
