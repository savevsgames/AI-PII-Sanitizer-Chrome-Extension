# Phase 0-1: Solo Founder Marketing Plan
**Target:** 0 → 100 users (validation phase)
**Timeline:** Months 1-3
**Team Size:** Just you
**Budget:** $0-500/month
**Goal:** Prove people want this before investing serious time

---

## The Core Problem You're Solving

**Don't waste time on community building or social media yet.** First, prove 3 things:
1. People actually try document upload (30%+ of users)
2. They're willing to pay ($19/month PRO tier)
3. Professionals in regulated industries care (lawyers, doctors, accountants)

---

## Week-by-Week Plan (Months 1-3)

### Week 1: Launch + Early Signal

**Goal:** Get 10-20 early adopters to validate core use case

**Actions (5 hours total):**
1. **Product Hunt Launch (2 hours)**
   - Post to Product Hunt on Tuesday-Thursday
   - Title: "ChatGPT Document Upload Protection - Keep Your Private Data Private"
   - Headline: "Upload contracts, medical notes, and tax documents to AI without leaking PII"
   - Use your 5 screenshots showing before/after PII redaction
   - **Success metric:** 50+ upvotes, 20+ signups

2. **Reddit (1 hour)**
   - r/ChatGPT: "PSA: Don't upload contracts to ChatGPT unless you redact PII first"
   - r/privacy: "Built a Chrome extension to auto-redact PII in ChatGPT uploads"
   - r/lawyers (if allowed): "How do you use ChatGPT without violating client confidentiality?"
   - **Don't be spammy** - provide value first, mention tool second

3. **HackerNews Show HN (1 hour)**
   - Title: "Show HN: Auto-redact PII when uploading documents to ChatGPT"
   - Focus on the technical approach (fetch interception, client-side encryption)
   - Dev community loves privacy + technical challenges
   - **Success metric:** Make front page, 10+ signups from devs

4. **Personal Network (1 hour)**
   - Email 20 friends/colleagues who use ChatGPT
   - Ask: "Would you pay $19/month to safely upload contracts/medical notes to ChatGPT?"
   - **Don't sell yet** - just validate willingness to pay

---

### Weeks 2-4: Validate Document Upload Use Case

**Goal:** Confirm 30%+ of users try document upload (your critical metric)

**Actions (3 hours/week = 9 hours total):**

1. **Monitor Analytics (30 min/week)**
   - Track: % of users who try document upload
   - Track: Average documents uploaded per user
   - Track: Upgrade rate (free → PRO)
   - **If <30% try upload:** The use case is weak, pivot to chat-only
   - **If >30% try upload:** You're onto something BIG

2. **User Interviews (1 hour/week)**
   - Email 5 users per week who uploaded documents
   - Ask 3 questions:
     1. "What document did you upload?" (legal, medical, financial?)
     2. "Would this be useful at work?" (validates B2B potential)
     3. "What's stopping you from upgrading to PRO?" (price, features, trust?)
   - **Goal:** Find 3 professionals (lawyer, doctor, accountant) who love it

3. **Content Marketing - ONE Article (1.5 hours/week)**
   - Week 2: "Why You Shouldn't Upload Contracts to ChatGPT (And How to Do It Safely)"
   - Week 3: "HIPAA Compliance and AI: Can Doctors Use ChatGPT?"
   - Week 4: "Accountants Using AI: How to Protect Client Tax Data"
   - Post to Medium, LinkedIn, personal blog
   - **SEO target:** "Can I upload [legal documents/medical notes/tax returns] to ChatGPT?"
   - **Goal:** Rank for long-tail search terms

---

### Weeks 5-8: Find Your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

**Goal:** Identify which vertical cares most (legal, healthcare, finance, accounting)

**Actions (4 hours/week = 16 hours total):**

1. **Vertical Landing Pages (2 hours/week)**
   - Create 4 landing pages:
     - promptblocker.com/for-lawyers
     - promptblocker.com/for-doctors
     - promptblocker.com/for-accountants
     - promptblocker.com/for-finance
   - Each page: Vertical-specific headline, use cases, testimonials (once you have them)
   - **Tool:** Use Webflow or Framer (no code, fast)

2. **Vertical-Specific Reddit/Forums (1 hour/week)**
   - r/LawFirm: "How are you using ChatGPT without violating client confidentiality?"
   - r/medicine: "Doctors using AI for clinical notes - HIPAA concerns?"
   - r/Accounting: "Tax preparers: Safe ways to use AI?"
   - **Provide value** - write 200+ words before mentioning your tool

3. **LinkedIn Outreach (1 hour/week)**
   - Find 20 lawyers/doctors/accountants on LinkedIn who post about AI
   - Comment on their AI posts with helpful insights
   - **After 2-3 interactions:** "I built a tool to help with this, would love your feedback"
   - **Goal:** 5 paying customers from your ICP by end of month 3

---

### Weeks 9-12: Prepare for Scale (Only If Validation Works)

**Goal:** If you have 50+ users and 3+ paying customers, prepare to hire help

**Actions (3 hours/week = 12 hours total):**

1. **Case Studies (2 hours/week)**
   - Interview your 3 paying customers
   - Write case studies: "[Law Firm Name] Uses ChatGPT Safely for Contract Review"
   - Get permission to use their name/logo (huge credibility boost)
   - Post on website, LinkedIn, send to prospects

2. **Pricing Validation (30 min/week)**
   - Test pricing: Offer 3 users $9/month (vs $19) - do they upgrade faster?
   - Test positioning: "Privacy tool" vs "Compliance tool" - which resonates?
   - **Goal:** Find optimal price point before scaling marketing

3. **Community Setup (30 min/week)**
   - **Only if users are engaged:** Create Discord or Slack community
   - **Don't force it** - only create community if users are asking for it
   - Alternative: Weekly office hours (Zoom call, answer questions)

## What NOT To Do (Time Wasters)

❌ **Don't build a huge social media presence yet**
- You need 1000+ users before Twitter/LinkedIn ROI is positive
- Save this for Phase 2 when you have help

❌ **Don't create a YouTube channel**
- Video production takes 10+ hours per video
- Only worth it if you hire a VA or have 10K+ users

❌ **Don't run paid ads yet**
- You need $5K+/month budget for statistically significant tests
- Save paid ads for Phase 2 with funding

❌ **Don't attend conferences**
- Costs $2K+ (ticket, travel, time)
- Only worth it if you have enterprise deals ready to close

❌ **Don't build partnerships yet**
- "Let's partner!" conversations go nowhere without traction
- Focus on users first, partnerships at 1000+ users

---

## Success Criteria (Month 3 Checkpoint)

### ✅ **GO TO PHASE 2** (Hire help, raise funding)
- 100+ total users
- 30%+ try document upload
- 5+ paying customers ($19/month PRO)
- 1+ pilot deal with SMB ($500-1K/month)
- Clear ICP identified (lawyers, doctors, or accountants)

### ⚠️ **PIVOT** (Change positioning or features)
- <30% try document upload → Focus on chat-only, lower price to $4.99
- <3% conversion to PRO → Features aren't compelling enough
- No professional users → Pivot to consumer market

### ❌ **STOP** (Not a viable business)
- <50 users after 3 months of effort
- <1% conversion to PRO
- No one values document upload protection

## Key Mindset Shifts

1. **You're validating, not scaling**
   - Don't optimize for growth yet
   - Optimize for learning: What use case do people care about?

2. **Talk to users > create content**
   - 10 user interviews = more valuable than 10 blog posts
   - You're looking for signal, not reach

3. **Professionals > consumers**
   - 1 lawyer paying $50/month > 10 consumers paying $4.99
   - Focus on ICP discovery, not mass market

4. **Document upload is your moat**
   - If 30%+ try upload: You're solving a real problem
   - If <30% try upload: Pivot or stop

5. **Don't optimize too early**
   - SEO, conversion funnels, A/B tests = Phase 2 work
   - Right now: Get 100 users, find 5 paying customers, validate ICP

---

## Tools You'll Actually Use

**Required (Free Tier):**
- Mixpanel (analytics) - Track document upload %
- ConvertKit (email) - Onboarding, announcements
- Calendly (scheduling) - User interviews
- Google Docs (case studies, notes)

**Optional ($15-30/month):**
- Webflow or Framer (landing pages) - Only if vertical pages needed
- Loom (video messages) - For personalized outreach

**Not Needed Yet:**
- HubSpot, Salesforce (too complex for 100 users)
- Buffer, Hootsuite (social media not a focus yet)
- Zapier, Make (automations not needed at this scale)

---

## Next Steps

**End of Month 3:**
- If success criteria met → Move to Phase 2: Small Team Marketing

- Hire VA or part-time marketer ($1K-2K/month)
- Start LinkedIn ads ($5K/month budget)
- Cold email outreach (100/week)
- Enterprise pilot program
- Raise seed round ($500K-2M)
