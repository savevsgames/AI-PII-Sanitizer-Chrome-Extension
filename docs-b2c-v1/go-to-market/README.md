## Philosophy: Time-Efficient Marketing

These plans are designed to **avoid wasting your time** on:

❌ **Community building** (before you have users who want it)
❌ **Social media** (before you have content/audience)
❌ **YouTube videos** (10+ hours per video, low ROI early on)
❌ **Conferences** ($2K+ per event, only worth it at scale)
❌ **Partnerships** (go nowhere without traction)

Instead, focus on:

✅ **Validation first** (prove use case before scaling)
✅ **User interviews** (10 interviews > 10 blog posts)
✅ **Direct outreach** (LinkedIn, email)
✅ **Vertical-specific content** (lawyers, doctors, accountants)
✅ **Document upload as core metric** (30%+ usage = product-market fit)

## Quick Decision Tree

**Start here:**
```
Do you have 100+ users?
├─ No  → Phase 0-1: Solo Founder
└─ Yes → Do you have $400K+ ARR?
    ├─ No  → Phase 2: Small Team
    └─ Yes → Do you have $2M+ funding?
        ├─ No  → Raise seed first, then Phase 3
        └─ Yes → Phase 3: Funded Scale
```

## Common Questions

### "Should I raise money before I have traction?"
**No.** Investors want to see:
- 100+ users (proof people want it)
- 5+ paying customers (proof people pay for it)
- 1+ enterprise pilot (proof companies buy it)

Complete Phase 1 first, then raise.

---

### "Can I skip Phase 2 and go straight to Phase 3?"
**No.** You need to prove:
- Repeatable sales motion (5-10 enterprise deals closed)
- Unit economics (CAC < 1/3 LTV)
- Product-market fit (30%+ document upload usage)

VCs won't fund unproven GTM.

---

### "What if I want to bootstrap instead of raise funding?"
**Use Phase 2 plan, but:**
- Hire slower (1-2 people, not 4)
- Lower ad spend ($5K/month, not $30K)
- Focus on high-margin prosumer ($19/month) instead of enterprise
- Timeline: 3-5 years to $1M+ ARR instead of 12-24 months

Bootstrap is viable but slower.

---

### "What if Microsoft/Google adds this feature to ChatGPT/Copilot?"
**Sell before they do.**

Best case:
- Phase 0-1: Months 1-3
- Phase 2: Months 4-12
- Phase 3: Months 13-36
- **Exit at Month 36 for $30-100M**

If you execute fast, you exit before big tech catches up.

---

### "What if I can't get to 30%+ document upload usage?"
**Pivot or stop.**

If <30% of users try document upload after 3 months:
- **Pivot:** Focus on chat-only protection, lower price to $4.99/month
- **Pivot:** Target different vertical (maybe developers want code protection more?)
- **Stop:** This might not be a big enough pain point

Document upload is your moat. If users don't care, the business is weaker.
