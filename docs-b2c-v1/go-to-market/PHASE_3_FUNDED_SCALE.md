**Team Size:** 20-30 people
**Budget:** $500K-1M+/month

## Phase 2 Recap: What You Proved

You should ONLY enter Phase 3 if you achieved:
- ✅ $400K+ ARR
- ✅ 30%+ MoM growth for 3+ months
- ✅ 5+ enterprise customers ($50K+ ACV)
- ✅ $2M+ seed funding raised

---

## Path to $5M+ ARR (Months 13-36)

### Conservative Case ($5M ARR by Month 36)
**Assumptions:**
- 60 new enterprise deals/year × $75K ACV = $4.5M new ARR/year
- 10% annual churn
- 20% expansion from existing customers

**Year 2 (Months 13-24):**
- Start: $400K ARR
- New bookings: $4.5M
- Churn: ($40K)
- Expansion: $80K
- **End Year 2: $4.94M ARR**

**Year 3 (Months 25-36):**
- Start: $4.94M ARR
- New bookings: $6M (scaled sales team)
- Churn: ($500K)
- Expansion: $1M
- **End Year 3: $11.44M ARR**

**Acquisition Value:** $11M ARR × 6x = **$66M exit**

---

### Aggressive Case ($10M ARR by Month 36)
**Assumptions:**
- 100 enterprise deals/year × $100K ACV = $10M new ARR/year
- 5% annual churn (better product-market fit)

- Start: $400K ARR
- New bookings: $10M
- Churn: ($40K)
- Expansion: $120K
- **End Year 2: $10.48M ARR**

**Acquisition Value:** $10M ARR × 7x = **$70M exit in Year 2**

---

**Playbook:**
1. **Build Relationships with Acquirers (Months 24-30)**

   - "We integrate with [systems they care about]"
   - "Our team has unique IP/expertise in AI security"

## Budget (Month 24 Steady State)

| Category | Monthly Spend | Annual Total |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Salaries** (30 people) | $500K | $6M |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | $150K | $1.8M |
| **Google Ads** | $100K | $1.2M |
| **Retargeting + ABM** | $50K | $600K |
| **Content Production** | $20K | $240K |
| **Events + Conferences** | $30K | $360K |
| **Tools & Software** | $20K | $240K |
| **Office / Operations** | $30K | $360K |
| **Reserve / Misc** | $100K | $1.2M |
| **TOTAL** | **$1M/month** | **$12M/year** |

**Revenue Needed to Break Even:** $12M ARR (won't hit until Year 3-4)

**Burn Rate:**
- Year 2: Burn $10-12M/year (funded by $2M seed + $10M Series A)
- Year 3: Burn $12-15M/year (funded by remaining Series A + revenue)

**Runway:** With $10M Series A raised at Month 24, you have 15-18 month runway → Enough to hit $5-10M ARR → Acquisition target

---

## Key Hires by Function (Months 13-36)

### Must-Hire Executives (First 12 Months)
1. **VP Sales** (Month 13) - Can't scale sales without sales leader
2. **VP Marketing** (Month 13) - Can't scale marketing without marketing leader
3. **Head of Product** (Month 16) - Founder shouldn't be PM forever
4. **Head of Operations** (Month 15) - Finance, legal, HR, recruiting

### Optional Executives (Months 24-36)
- **CFO** (Month 28) - Only if planning Series B or M&A
- **CRO (Chief Revenue Officer)** (Month 30) - Combines sales + marketing + CS

---

## Metrics That Matter (For Acquisition)

Acquirers care about these 5 metrics:

1. **ARR Growth Rate**
   - Target: 70-100%+ YoY
   - $5M → $10M ARR (100% growth) is acquisition-ready

2. **Gross Margin**
   - Target: 80-90%
   - SaaS with Chrome extension = minimal COGS

3. **Net Dollar Retention (NDR)**
   - Target: 110-130%
   - Expansion > churn = healthy business

4. **Magic Number (Sales Efficiency)**
   - Formula: (Net New ARR in Quarter) / (Sales & Marketing Spend Previous Quarter)
   - Target: >0.75 (efficient growth)

5. **Customer Concentration**
   - Target: No single customer >10% of ARR
   - Diversified customer base = less risk for acquirer

---

## Exit Scenarios

### Scenario A: Strategic Acquisition (Most Likely)
**Acquirer:** Zscaler, Cloudflare, Okta, Palo Alto Networks
**Timing:** Month 30-36 ($5-10M ARR)
**Valuation:** 5-8x ARR = **$30-80M**
**Structure:** Cash + some equity in acquirer
**Outcome:** Team stays for 2-3 years (earn-out), product integrated into acquirer's platform

---

### Scenario B: Growth Equity / Series B (Less Likely)
**Investor:** Growth equity firm (Vista, Thoma Bravo, Insight Partners)
**Timing:** Month 36+ ($10M+ ARR)
**Valuation:** 8-12x ARR = **$80-120M**
**Structure:** $30-50M Series B, minority stake
**Outcome:** Scale to $50-100M ARR over 3-5 years, then strategic exit or IPO

---

### Scenario C: Acqui-Hire (Fallback)
**Acquirer:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google
**Timing:** If growth stalls at $2-5M ARR
**Valuation:** $10-20M (team value, not revenue multiple)
**Structure:** Mostly stock in acquirer
**Outcome:** Product shut down, team joins acquirer's AI security efforts

---

## Common Failure Modes (Avoid These)

❌ **Scaling sales too fast before product-market fit**
- Symptom: Churning through AEs, missing quota
- Solution: Fix sales motion at 2 AEs before hiring 10 AEs

❌ **Burning too much on brand marketing**
- Symptom: "Awareness" campaigns with no pipeline
- Solution: Only invest in brand after $5M+ ARR, focus on demand gen until then

❌ **Ignoring competition**
- Symptom: Microsoft/Google builds native AI data redaction
- Solution: Differentiate on cross-platform + advanced features, or sell before they ship

❌ **Over-raising at too high valuation**
- Symptom: Raise $30M at $150M valuation, can't grow into it
- Solution: Raise what you need ($10-20M Series A), not what VCs offer

❌ **Trying to IPO instead of selling**
- Symptom: Turn down $60M acquisition offer, try to get to $100M ARR
- Solution: Take the exit if it's good, don't get greedy

---

## Phase 3 Success Criteria (Month 36)

### ✅ **Acquisition-Ready** (Ideal Outcome)
- $5-10M ARR
- 50-70% YoY growth
- 80-90% gross margin
- 110-130% net retention
- 50-100+ enterprise customers
- 3-5 serious acquisition conversations happening
- **Exit in next 12 months for $30-100M**

### ⚠️ **Series B Path** (Alternative Outcome)
- $10-20M ARR
- 70-100% YoY growth
- Strong unit economics
- Raise $30-50M Series B
- **Scale to $50M+ ARR, exit in 4-5 years**

### ❌ **Stalled Growth** (Problem)
- $2-5M ARR with slowing growth
- <30% YoY growth
- High churn, poor unit economics
- **Either pivot, acqui-hire, or wind down**

---

## Final Thoughts: Building to Sell

**This is not a lifestyle business.**

If you're entering Phase 3, you're playing the venture game:
- Raise $10-20M+ in funding
- Hire 20-30+ people
- Burn $10-15M+/year
- Scale fast or die

**The goal:** Get to $5-10M ARR in 24-36 months, position for strategic acquisition at $30-100M.

**The exit:** You sell to Zscaler, Cloudflare, Okta, or similar acquirer who wants your customer base, team, and technology as part of their AI security strategy.

**The outcome:** $10-30M+ payout for founder (depends on dilution, vesting, etc.), team gets liquidity, product lives on inside bigger company.

**The alternative:** If acquisition doesn't happen, you need to raise Series B and scale to $50M+ ARR → Much harder, takes 5-7 years total, not 3-4 years.

**Recommendation:** Take the strategic acquisition if you get an offer at $30M+ in Year 2-3. Don't get greedy trying to build a unicorn.
